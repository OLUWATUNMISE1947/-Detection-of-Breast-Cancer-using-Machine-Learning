# -Detection-of-Breast-Cancer-using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a machine learning model to detect breast cancer by analyzing medical data. As one of the most common cancers worldwide, early detection is crucial for treatment and survival. Using machine learning, the model classifies tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features, improving early diagnosis.
The dataset used for this project typically includes attributes such as tumor size, shape, and texture, as well as other key indicators. The machine learning algorithms applied include logistic regression, Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gaussian Naive Bayes to identify patterns and relationships within the data.

The outcome of this project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a tool that supports decision-making, improving early diagnosis, and ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

Key Information:
1.	ID number: A unique identifier for each sample.
2.	Diagnosis: The target variable, where:
o	'M' represents Malignant
o	'B' represents Benign

Features Computed for Each Cell Nucleus:
1.	Radius: The mean distance from the center to points on the perimeter of the nucleus.
2.	Texture: The standard deviation of gray-scale values.
3.	Perimeter: The perimeter of the nucleus.
4.	Area: The area of the nucleus.
5.	Smoothness: A measure of local variation in radius lengths.
6.	Compactness: Computed as (PerimeterÂ² / Area) - 1.0.
7.	Concavity: Describes the severity of concave portions of the contour.
8.	Concave points: Number of concave portions of the nucleus contour.
9.	Symmetry: Measures the symmetry of the nucleus.
10.	Fractal Dimension: Approximates the "coastline" of the nucleus using fractal geometry.


Key Steps:

Data collection and preprocessing
Feature engineering and selection
Model selection and training
Model evaluation and optimization
Technologies and Tools: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Conclusion
By training machine learning models on this dataset, it is possible to develop a predictive model that can significantly assist in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, providing a valuable tool for medical professionals.
