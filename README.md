# -Detection-of-Breast-Cancer-using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a machine learning model to detect breast cancer by analyzing medical data. As one of the most common cancers worldwide, early detection is crucial for treatment and survival. Using machine learning, the model classifies tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features, improving early diagnosis.
The dataset used for this project typically includes attributes such as tumor size, shape, and texture, as well as other key indicators. The machine learning algorithms applied include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and neural networks, among others, to identify patterns and relationships within the data.

The modelâ€™s performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring high reliability and robustness. Feature selection techniques will also be applied to identify the most critical factors influencing the diagnosis.

The outcome of this project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a tool that supports decision-making, improving early diagnosis, and ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

Key Steps:

Data collection and preprocessing
Feature engineering and selection
Model selection and training
Model evaluation and optimization
Deployment and integration with a clinical decision-making system
Technologies and Tools: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
