# -Detection-of-Breast-Cancer-using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a machine learning model to detect breast cancer by analyzing medical data. As one of the most common cancers worldwide, early detection is crucial for treatment and survival. Using machine learning, the model classifies tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features, improving early diagnosis.
